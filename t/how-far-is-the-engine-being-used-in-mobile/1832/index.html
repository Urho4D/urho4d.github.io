       Hi guys
      </p>
      <p>
       we are starting to use Urho and it looks great!
       <br/>
       As we move on we our tests we are stumbling in a few things, tough. For example, Galaxy S6 is rendering black, which is a bit weird for a top device that is out for more than 1 year. Another thing, we were trying to copy texture bytes to a buffer and it seems it is not possible. GetData complains “with not support” error
      </p>
      <p>
       cheers

       Getting texture data back to CPU is not supported in the same way on OpenGL ES 2 as on desktop GL. Haven’t fully investigated workarounds for that though.
      </p>

       Urho has certainly been used for mobile projects, but especially in Android mobile use, which is generally regarded as a nightmare of hardware compatibility or driver issues even by professional devs, it’s safest to interpret the MIT license pessimistically regarding what it says of warranties for fitness of purpose (= there are none.) We may not have means to debug a bug on a specific device unlike commercial engines, which have their test farms. So in practice it works best if a user encountering a problem on specific device can contribute a fix, then everyone benefits.

       Guys
      </p>
      <p>
       after UrhoSharp announcement, Urho3d immediately jumped into our radars. We are working on version 2.0 of Storyo, a mobile app developed in c# through Xamarin. We can find following links two possible outputs that we have today:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We are currently trying to build a 3D player of stories based on Urho and, of course, getting texture data is crucial to encode videos.
       <br/>
       As for Android and hw compatibility, yes we know it well!

       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       A possible workaround is to use glReadPixels, it’ll cause a massive bubble in the CPU/GPU pipeline though. I had a mode where you can take a photo of the screen and it paused the screen for a solid 1 second on Android and iOS (probably because the GPUs on there are heavily pipelined, more so than desktop GPUs).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are extensions and EGL ones too which can get around this, but it’s all different on every hardware, I don’t recommend that rabbit hole…
       <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/8a8941f0486df9dda1e89ec988e1591cf959e1ea7809a249dc2decb694b30a6c.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>
       ES 3.x fortunately supports Pixel Buffer Objects which can probably get around this quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m rendering to an S6 here, I’ve found that it renders for like 2 seconds and freezes the frame, and I need to use the task manager to go to another app, then back to Urho and then it works fine. I recommend you try this (I haven’t investigated the solution yet). Once SDL 2.0.4 lands I also have ES 3.x patches to apply, which I’ve tested on an S6.

       To have a better notion of what can be causing issues like the one we’ve been experiencing in Galaxy S6 (rendering black), can you guys give us a direction where to search for it? It “smells” to an issue with a shader used by the engine.

       I’ve run into Linux machines where the FXAA3 shader wouldn’t compile. Which caused a black screen (except for 2D UI elements). Not appending it to the effect RenderPath solved the problem then.

       I am learning game programing using UrhoSharp(C# wrapper library from Xamarin). So far everything worked great on Android for me.
