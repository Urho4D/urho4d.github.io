       I created a massive headache for myself recently - I had smashed out a bunch of classes deriving from Serializable, created a tree of specialized nodes (a custom set of derived node classes, nothing to do with Urho3D::Node), and during destruction, I was landing in Context::RemoveEventReceiver, on my deepest node (initially), with pthis=nullptr
       <br/>
       As my project pulls in the (release) Urho lib, I could not easily investigate the cause of the crash, but I do know my way around ASM, and I was able to inspect the disassembled code and the CPU registers to figure out that one of my objects had not correctly initialized the context_ member.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue was caused as follows:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-auto">MyClass::MyClass(Context* context):ItsAncestor(context_) { }</code></pre>
      <p>
       Can you see the problem?
       <br/>
       It’s such a subtle bug, but it’s super-nasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The input argument “context” is valid on entry - but that’s not what we handed to the ancestor!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a friendly heads-up incase someone else is wondering why their code crashes silently!

       Should the compiler warn you for unused input argument?

       I handed in the placeholder member, which we inherited from serializable (actually from Object, deeper again), I did not pass the input argument as intended
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a train ticket to pass to the conductor, but i showed him my empty pocket before he had handed me the ticket back to put in my pocket
      </p>
      <p>
       the input argument was called context
       <br/>
       the thing i handed the ancestor was the ultimate holder of context, called context_
      </p>
      <p>
       at the time i did so, context_ was still empty
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, the compiler should warn you, about unused inputs, if they have no defaults specified
      </p>
      <p>
       it never ceases to amuse me, as a programmer, how one character out of place can crash the entire machine
      </p>
      <p>
       in my days as an industrial robotics coder, once i put the decimal point in the wrong place in one number in a huge program, and quite some time later, a 50 tonne robot attempted to tear itself apart, at full speed - 30 meters per minute back then (I happened to be nearby, but I was also running other machines too)

       Yes, for arguments which have no default value specified, for sure - maybe not if there is a default, because it could be a throw-away value depending on the whim of the caller
