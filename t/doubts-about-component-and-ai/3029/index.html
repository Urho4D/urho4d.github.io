       Hello, I’m porting an app to urho and I’d like someone to consider on the following.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my old architecture I’m using EntityX. This is a pure ECS, where components are just data, and systems are function which operates on that data.
       <br/>
       I’m trying to relate this to Urho. In Urho, nodes are containers, and components looks like a specialization of nodes, where one node becames a skybox, a model, and so on.
       <br/>
       Then there are logic components, which looks like a behavioural specialization of components.
      </p>
      <p>
       My app is based on a specialized form of flocking. I have a group of nodes which acts as a whole, moved by specialized path functions, sort of screen-walking sprites grouped together and creating harmonies and disharmonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until now, I’ve put all these things into the update cycle and manage everything from a generalized form of AI over data management.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my understanding, in urho I should:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        transform the whole group in different nodes under a group parent node;
       </li>
       <li>
        create related sprites components
       </li>
       <li>
        put all the flocking AI into the parent logic component
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Moreover, part of ECS is used as a FSM game manager for level AI. Is this to be managed as a subsystem? To my understanding, subsystems are application-wide objects so that’d like to be its place… but not sure about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can someone share its thought about?
