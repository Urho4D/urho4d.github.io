       Hey guys, Iâ€™d just like to confirm something about the order of component initialization.
       <br/>
       I found that, due to some subtle dependencies in my current project, that after Loading a scene, I would have to do a bit of housekeeping to fix up broken pointers etc. (mainly weak refs to other components).
       <br/>
       I figured that the perfect place to do that was in the DelayedStart method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone confirm that the virtual DelayedStart method on Logic components is executed in the same order that the components appear in their scene hierarchy? And can I assume that I have an iron-clad guarantee about the order in which components will be processed generally?
       <br/>
       I know that Update and FixedUpdate are called at different rates, but what of the order that components receive events?
      </p>
