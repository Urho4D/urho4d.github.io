       Hi all!
       <br/>
       I am complete newbie to Urho (and 3D engines in general). I don’t know the internals very well, and I am curious about running the engine “headless” and streaming the resulting video to an external HW device. I am aware that there is Headless mode in Urho, which however does not run the rendering steps and no GPU-related stuff (is this correct?).
       <br/>
       Could I, theoretically, render to some memory location, get the image form there and process it as I want without displaying the window? Or is there some blocking issue why this cannot be done? I need to render roughly 2000x2000px image and stream it out the computer, only option I have now is render in window, take Camera screenshot and stream it. However having to display 2000x2000px windows is quite impractical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for your thoughts on this
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. Thanks everybody for working on this excellent engine. Everything is so intuitive, well-modeled and easy to use. GREAT JOB!!!

       Welcome to the forums!
      </p>
      <p>
       Headless mode, as it is understood by Urho, is meant for non-graphical applications like dedicated servers - a rendering window and graphics context is not created at all. This means that none of the graphics / rendering functionality is usable.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, to get a working graphics context, you should open a window, but its size doesn’t matter, it can be very small like 100 x 100, and you don’t need to render into it at all. Instead you should render into a Texture2D, which can be sized as large as your GPU allows, and use the Texture2D::GetData() function to get the pixel data every frame. See the RenderToTexture example.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I’ll make no promises whether the performance will be fast enough for realtime video streaming; your usecase is outside of what I’d strictly consider “supported” by the engine.

       Looks like a useful way to accomplish what I need. I don’t mind having a small preview window with downscaled large texture - it’s actually something I wanted anyway. I don’t think that performance should be an issue at this point (I made some tests), and I am exceeding my requirements already on my laptop.

       Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
