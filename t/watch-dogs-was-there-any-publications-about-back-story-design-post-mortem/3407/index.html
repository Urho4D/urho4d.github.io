       Hi, all!
      </p>
      <p>
       I have completed Watch_dogs so many times on youtube but still fascinated by unique great ideas
       <br/>
       implwmwnted in this game. While many people find it very shallow experience, I really find it fascinating, especially “hack” activities regarding passing through several security cameras, and everything like this. So is there some game design videos/presentations about Watch_Dogs? Any post-mortem or “Creating” video? Here I mean first game, not watch_dogs 2 (not seen that yet).
