       Hey guys,
      </p>
      <p>
       Another small release here. I have been playing around with creating various tools and helpers in C++. This time around we have a basic editor designed to create Mahjong tile layouts. Dynamic grid sizing and menu bar is ported from the Urho3D editor since it was originally done in Angelscript.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I wanted to keep things as simple and portable as possible, I used CustomGeometry for everything but the base scene. I also separated the editor away from my main project, so there shouldnâ€™t be too much unrelated code.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some notes:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Adjust grid size and layers dynamically.
       </li>
       <li>
        Use CTRL + LMB to place a tile.
       </li>
       <li>
        Use RMB to look around.
       </li>
       <li>
        Camera is clamped to adjustable min/max area
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

       I have updated the editor to include the following changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Added save ability based on Urho3D editor
       </li>
       <li>
        Added further tile validation
       </li>
       <li>
        Fixed ability to move around tiles
       </li>
       <li>
        Many bug fixes
       </li>
       <li>
        Many more additions/fixes
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I will probably not be updating this project anymore. The editor has gotten to the point where it will be brought over and implemented in my own project. I will likely release a full mahjong solitaire demo sometime in the near future.
