       Is this an oversight or intentional? Urho3D lib and its sub-libs like SDL uses pthread on Unix-like platforms. I have not observed an Urho3D app to bad-behave even though it was built without this define. When I call the “SDL-config --cflags”, its output clearly states that SDL expects this define. Yet none have reported any problems. What gives?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have time to do some research on this subject this morning and found this article that explains the potential danger of mixing supposedly multi-threading app linking with pthread but without the “_REENTRANT” define set with glibc that does. See
       <a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/faq.html#H">
        pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxt … faq.html#H
       </a>
       . It makes sense to me, which is why I even bother to search for the answer in the first place. I cannot explain why Urho3D app does not crash spectacularly on Linux/OSX though. Or is it just accident waiting to happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Separately, I have done a quick test using GCC and Clang on my Linux box and Clang on my OSX box. When given ‘-pthread’ compiler flag, they all emit “-D_REENTRANT” compiler defines to the compiler. And I have done a quick build test using GCC on Linux, this flag also instructs linker to link against “pthread” implicitly. From what I read, it instructs linker to link against a platform-specific library for multi-threading automatically. So it is portable too although we do not really need it because we do not support other niche *nix platforms yet at the moment. It only took me awhile to reconfigure our build system to use this compiler flags. However, I would like to hear from others, especially from Lasse, on what yours/his take on this matter before pushing my changes.

       We have a bastardized CMakeList for SDL which is missing a lot of platform checks for Unixes, as at the time of original SDL adoption SDL’s own CMakeList was broken. Their own CMakeList does
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-auto">set(PTHREAD_CFLAGS "-D_REENTRANT")
set(PTHREAD_LDFLAGS "-pthread")</code></pre>
      <p>
       so it’s certainly what we should be doing as well. As a sidenote, once 2.0.4 is out it might be worth to migrate to their CMakeList, if it works right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for lack of problems is probably that using the affected C library functions happens only in the main thread, while the worker threads mostly do just basic memory allocation and data processing.

       Thanks for the quick reply. Yes, your reasoning for lack of problem is plausible. I am making some build tests on my OSX box as I speak. I will push it when all are OK.

       EDIT: I have pushed my changes. I forgot to reset the OS clock to current time before pushing (I usually just save/restore VM session without actually rebooting it), so the newly pushed changes appears to be made by me 25 days ago.
