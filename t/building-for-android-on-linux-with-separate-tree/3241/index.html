       Hi, all!
      </p>
      <p>
       How can I build for Android
       <strong>
        <em>
         on Linux host
        </em>
       </strong>
       when I have separate tree for my project?
      </p>
      <p>
       i.e. I build Urho for Android as static library.
       <br/>
       How can I build my project for Android? Are instruction are the same as for normal Linux build,
       <br/>
       or there are differencies? How to make .apk with my project after this?
       <br/>
       (yes, I tried searching the forum, but it seems my use case is unpopular)
       <br/>
       (no, I’m not noob, I just not experienced developer
       <strong>
        <em>
         for
        </em>
       </strong>
       Android, while porting Android to various devices
       <br/>
       is a part of my $$$ job, i.e. I extremely rarely do apps, I work with core system and frameworks)
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as my device is “rooted” (actually never was “unrooted”), is it possible to just put files on device and edit them there to save
       <br/>
       on deployment during development? As I prototype using AngelScript, sometimes I want to check
       <br/>
       if that will be good for Android or not…

       Our build process is largely the same for different build/host system. Contrary to your view, Linux is a first class citizen as a build/host system as well as target platform. In fact it may work better than the rest simply because all our CI are tested on Ubuntu VM.

       As for your problem, I don’t see it in your post. Please try it first by following our online documentation page and report back exactly where you have failed.
