       I’m deciding between Panda and Urho and i wanted to know if Urho supports deferred rendering and PBR, like Panda?

       Urho3D supports deferred rendering. PBR is not currently supported. But since Urho3D lets you set custom shaders for both the G-Buffer filling pass and the deferred lights themselves, and it supports custom G-buffer layouts, there’s no reason you couldn’t implement it yourself, no source code changes necessary. The flexibility of Urho3D’s rendering system was a big draw for me. You can pretty much do anything you want with it, as long you don’t need geometry shaders, tesselation, or compute shaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       That new Panda3D rendering system looks fantastic, though. I’ll need to check that engine out. The only issue is that it requires OpenGL 4.3, at the moment.

       I feel the metalness/roughness method is probably the better direction, and is the direction I would take my work. It’s definitely a large amount of work for one person to do, between:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Basic surface shader (forward and deferred) and all the possible techniques
       </li>
       <li>
        Extended shaders like hair, terrain, vegetation, skin, wetness, alpha
       </li>
       <li>
        PBR lights
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Extra features like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        parallax corrected cubemapping
       </li>
       <li>
        Reflection probe and blending
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I took a shot at a few of those things, but it would need a lot more love to get it where it should be.

       Cheers for the Panda3D link! That could be a great base to work from for Urho3D albeit it targets the highest high-end deferred-only. Bumping the GL version from 3.x to 4.3+ at startup time with a flag could be done though, with graceful fallbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Panda3D codebase is quite epic though, I would rather just extend Urho3D with these same features than go into the C++/Python combo (Python is absolutely excellent for tools dev, I would never ever use it in a game runtime though). Is it true it’s like 40 mins to compile Panda on a modern rig???
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m biased towards VFX so I’d go spec/roughness vs roughness/metallic at least for the working set of files, although it’s a smaller memory footprint with the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would really like to see how area lights could be incorporated to keep it more physically plausible, but I think producing shadows for these lights you need either raycasting in compute or a voxelised scene to cone trace.

       As another python coder, I already tried Panda3D and Tobias’ RenderPipeline build. RenderPipeline is still experimental so I would not bet on it to make serious or mid size PBR based games yet, it is great for tech demos though
       <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/f6b86554472159b74d0ab91b2cb3cd75cf361ccf96a141a4ebd3363c38e7f8eb.png" title=":wink:"/>
       . The build time is really slow (vanilla Panda3d) and could take as much as a couple of hours if you include all options, which is the default. Sources and generated files also  huge around 8GB total.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were large scale and established MMO games with Panda3D so I would say it’s really another great engine.
