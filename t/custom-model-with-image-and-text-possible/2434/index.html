       Hey guys ,
      </p>
      <p>
       this is the first time i’m using urho and i had a question .
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible to create a model that takes an image (local or url) with some text .
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g - instead of the ragdolls or boxes - i want something like a billboard
      </p>
      <p>
       like this :
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TJ62e" rel="nofollow noopener">
        imgur.com/a/TJ62e
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a scene and a plane - this will be on the plane .
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you , i would be very grateful if anyone can tell me how to do this - i have zero experience with graphics.
       <br/>
       If i can use a web url for the image - even better - else local.
      </p>

       yes, you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few concepts that you should get familiar with to get started.
       <br/>
       First, Urho uses “nodes” to “hold” information. In this case, a grid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1: In the editor, create a local node.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, a lot of game logic, or logic that can be attached to nodes, are done with “components”.
       <br/>
       So far, you have a node in the scene. Which is nothing more than a invisible point in a scene that has transformation information. Or simply information on where in the 3d scene the node is, and the rotation and scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2: If you want a simple grid to put on an image, with the node selected. add a “static mesh” component.
       <br/>
       This static mesh component will allow you to load in any static mdl. Urho has a few general ones.
       <br/>
       You should see a paramaters pane in the editor for your static mesh component, that you can choose to load the mdl onto. Select the Grid.mdl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step3:
       <br/>
       Finally to get a image on this grid.
       <br/>
       Within the same static mesh component, after you have loaded the grid mdl, there is another paramater further down, that you can choose a material. (Im not infront of a working urho build, so the instructions might be a little incorrect). I would just try a simple material, Lit maybe, or DefaultLit.
       <br/>
       You should be able to inspect the material, and load a local image into the diffuse parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 4: You might need to add a light to the scene as well.
       <br/>
       Make a node, make a light component, and change the light to directional. and rotate it so it lights up your grid.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should get you a very very basic set up.
       <br/>
       (when I am infront of a proper urho build, I can save out a scene.xml that you can load, if you havent managed to get this far)

       Thanks a lot ghida , Highly appreciated .
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m very unfamiliar with the urho editor - i tried it last night and was completely lost
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been coding directly in c# so far based on the samples
