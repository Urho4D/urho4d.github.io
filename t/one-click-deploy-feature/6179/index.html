       We can see that other engines like JmonkeyEngine, Godot, RenPy have this content to export with a click. What I mean is: having the facility to export to any platform without having to recompile or having to find the binaries for each platform. In these engines we can export with just a window to platforms with their SDK or not (depending on the engine).Urho3D is able to do this? I’m crazy for a complete C ++ engine that I can write the code from scratch (c++ script?) but I don’t see this option here. Can I do this with CMake? If this is possible, could someone please explain to me?
      </p>
      <p>
       @ Edit: how is to use Urho3D comparing to Unreal Engine 4, cause this engine uses c++, right?

       TL;DR: No, it cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Longer answer: 1-click deployment for C++ means that the engine should be able to properly execute build system from within itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the engine should either contain
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       necessary SDKs and tools within, or require user to install them. First option is not viable for “all-built-from-source” project like Urho. Second option is… not really helpful. If you have to manually install exact versions of Android SDK, Emscripten SDK and whatever in order to do 1-click deployment, you can as well just make *.bat file that does exact same “1-click deployment”.
      </p>
      <p>
       This process can be simplified a bit, but at the end of the day it’s won’t be that helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Morever, C++ code cannot be built for iOS unless you run build from MacOS (AFAIK).
       <br/>
       I have no idea how 1-click deployment is even supposed to work in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the engine is distributed in binaries, it doesn’t have this kind of problems at all (e.g. Unity).
       <br/>
       If the engine is distributed in source… I have no clue. It either requires user to install 3rdparty SDKs manually or downloads their binaries automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t say it’s impossible to do. I just say that whole Urho infrastructure follow the opposite approach and Editor/BuildSystem rework is required in order to make it happen.

       . What you see in other engines is some form of “encapsulating scripting and the export your scripting”, the c++ is prebuilt and is always the same piece.
       <br/>
       Urho has encapsulating scripting: many samples but especially the player in AS.
       <br/>
       Auto building is not possible afaik. But you could aim for super-simplified build process, like with

       Actually there might be some kind of one-click-deployments if you utilize dockerized build system.

       I think it may now be possible to build for iOS not on a Mac:

       And, while I don’t know whether it’s in violation of the license agreement or not, I’ve read that it’s also possible to run MacOS in a virtual machine.

       Doesn’t really feel as easy/reliable way to build stuff. Also, linux only.
       <br/>
       VM looks simpler to setup, and this is probably the way to go if one wants to build for iOS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both options are not really viable for out-of-the-box cross-compiling on iOS in one click, anyway.
