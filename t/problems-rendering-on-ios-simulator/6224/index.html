       I and using UrhoSharp to crate a visualization of the Galaxy.  The Urho3D scene is rendering fine on an actual device, but when I use the iPhone simulator on an iMac, there are rendering uses where sections of nodes appear and disappear depending on the camera’s orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this a known problem?  The compile/run turnaround time on a device is quite a bit longer than on the simulator so I’d like to use the simulator if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If important, my iMac uses a Radeon Pro 560X 4 GB graphics chip.

       You probably know the ios simulator and a real device are two completely different beasts. On a mac, the ios env is simulated. You’re really running on mac graphic card. That is only intended for simple testing on Apple sdk.
       <br/>
       In short, do not expect it to work. Besides, UrhoSharp is abandonware…

       Yes, I’m well aware that the simulator uses the Mac’s graphics card.  That is why I included its specs in my original post.  I have not seen any mention that Urho3D doesn’t work on Macs.  There are build scripts for the Mac so I would assume it is designed to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could believe that Urho3D doesn’t work in the iOS simulator.  Is that a known issue?

       It is distressing to hear you say the UrhoSharp is abandonware.  Microsoft’s Xamarin website is still promoting it as
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       way to do 3D graphics in Xamarin.  I’m basing a new, important project on UrhoSharp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think the project has been abandoned?  What is one supposed to use for 3D graphics in Xamarin?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  OK, I did find this:

       <br/>
       Would anyone care to comment?  I was hoping to create a cross-platform app (iOS, macOS, Android, UWP) that embedded a Urho3D view.  Is this not possible?

       Take a look at
       <a href="https://github.com/rokups/rbfx" rel="nofollow noopener">
        rbfx
       </a>
       . It’s a Urho3D fork with extensive C# support.

      <p>
       Their Github repository has a link to their Gitter. Maybe you could ask them if it supports what you need.
