       I have a bit of a problem involving physics collision detection.
      </p>
      <p>
       The player character is holding a weapon, which is attached to their right hand.
       <br/>
       The zombie character has an animated ragdoll armature of rigidbodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       When player character attacks zombie with weapon, and when weapon collides with zombie bodypart, I am notified of the collision: which bodies took part, and the parent nodes of those two rigidbodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know that a weapon has struck a specific bodypart on a zombie.
       <br/>
       But I don’t know which player was wielding that weapon, or which zombie was struck!
      </p>
      <p>
       The node information I am provided is too deep in the scene hierarchies of these two characters to tell which characters were involved!
      </p>
      <p>
       String tags seem like a bad choice to identify parentage, and the Bullet Physics userpointers are already being used by Urho3D.
      </p>
      <p>
       Urho3D’s RigidBody and Node classes do not support user pointers which I could set to identify my owner object.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any recommendations about how to tag Urho3D objects as being related to some other object, particularly with regards to rapidly identifying the root grandparent of a deeply nested child?

       Maybe you could set up a variant for a node and store the body parts. Even better idea is to send your own events. That’s how i did it.

       Thanks for the input, Dave82!
      </p>

       It looks like I can use Node::SetVar to set a named Variant, which can hold either a naked pointer (void*) or more safely, a RefCounted pointer.
       <br/>
       String Tags really are a horrible idea, but the Node class does have support for multiple named and typed user variables, including pointers, so I consider this case solved. Your mention of “variant on a node” is what reminded me to look into exactly what I can do with node variables. Cheers!
