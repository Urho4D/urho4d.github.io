       Urho3d is very good game engine but it has a big problem. How to develop a game engine for free? Look on Godot
       <a href="https://godotengine.org" rel="nofollow noopener">
        https://godotengine.org
       </a>
       this game engine is funded through patreon and  game engine is stunning. For my opinion if urho3d developpers wants to push this engine to the next level they needs to start founding campain on some funding service.
       <br/>
       So many people want to support this game engine through funding service but there is no way to do that. In my opinion Urho3d developpers should imitate godot funding system.
       <br/>
       What do you think about it?

       Funding something is no less effort than developing it… so basically the effort doubles.

       its  current goal is to create an editor for Urho3D with a better workflow, more functionality and Qt GUI. I intend to share.
       <img alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/8a8941f0486df9dda1e89ec988e1591cf959e1ea7809a249dc2decb694b30a6c.png" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"/>

       . He’s leading an effort to make a stand-alone console from Raspberry Pi’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe there’s a different developer who’s efforts you greatly appreciate. You can always ask the required information to transfer money through PM. As a bonus you could avoid those evil credit card companies and high transfer costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t think there’s anything stopping people from funding efforts apart from being unaware of everyday possibilities. Also centralization of the project’s finances introduces many questions which may demand a democratic complexity that takes more time then the money could buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that everything so far has been written without these monetary incentives. Also I don’t know much about Godot, but a friend of mine - and long time C++ programmer and teacher - gained interest in Urho3D after working with Godot for a while.

       Lastly, if you’re looking for a heavily feature-packed engine, Urho3D (Core) does not aspire to be that:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Urho3D is a free
        <em>
         lightweight

        , cross-platform 2D and 3D game engine implemented in C++ and released under the MIT license. Greatly inspired by OGRE and Horde3D.

       I think the only thing missing from the engine is a full editor, for everything, export, etc.
       <br/>
       I don’t think it would even take money to engage developers.
       <br/>
       The engine already has a lot of things and it’s pretty fast, you can do a lot of lightweight projects with that or modern AAA projects, I think.
       <br/>
       Not long ago I’ve been here, it seems to me that the project is more developed by the community, but I have a question too, Urho3D has ManaWarg (
       <span class="mention">
        @Modanung
       </span>
       ), rbfx, the InGame project editor …
       <br/>
       Why, as the project is currently developed more by the community, doesn’t the community come together to just make one? As an option to export, script in the editor, and with a beautiful design. It would be awesome!
       <br/>
       I think this separation is only costing more time to attract more people to use Urho3D and to see that it’s cool to learn from scratch (godot got visual script and the migration from paid engines is big)
       <br/>
       I hope someday to be able to help here.

       Well in any case, I think we need to grow in infrastructure(web, resources, docs,…) before planning a patreon.

       In another opensource project I was involved, contributors were contacted directly (as suggests
       <span class="mention">

       ) and were offered related HW(maybe money too, but in my case I was only offered HW).

      <p>
       In such way, paypal &amp; other intermediates don’t take their %, and you get to decide who deserves the most…
