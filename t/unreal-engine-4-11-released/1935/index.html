       I don’t really follow other engines but this seems to be some mayor news. Quite interesting what other engines are working on.
       <br/>
       They worked a lot on character stuff like on improving skin, eyes, cloth shadowing and ground shadowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also improved hair rendering but it stills looks weird: Looks more like nylon or spider web threads.
       <br/>

       Maybe that’s because there are no shadows in the hair? It also looks kinda grainy and the strands seem rather thick. Could still be improved but I guess it’s getting better in general. Compared to the rest of the characters the hair looks way more unrealistic I think.
      </p>

       Also interesting that many, even recent, CGI movies look worse as some of the Unreal images.
