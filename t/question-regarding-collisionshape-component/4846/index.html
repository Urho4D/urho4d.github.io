       Bullet is quite ok to share CollisionShapes among many RigidBodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does our CollisionShape Component create a unique bullet collisionshape object per instance, or is it somehow able to recognize familiar collision shape objects as shared resources?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am getting at, is that if we have a thousand boxes all the same size, or a thousand mushrooms, we do not need a thousand copies of the same shape information.

       I might not be the best person to answer this as my inner knowledge of the engine is quite limited, but from having had a (brief) look at the physics code, I noticed the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the complex shapes (mesh and hull based) share the geometry
       </li>
       <li>
        the primitive shapes are not shared but each node has individual copies
       </li>
       <li>
        internally all collision shape assigned to a Urho node are composite shapes
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I guess this design trades the efficiency of sharing shapes with the flexibility of allowing you to easily add/remove any number of collision shapes to any node and automatically letting you have a transform for each shape (primitive shapes assume your model is centered which is really rarely the case).
