       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       I encountering a quite strange issue. I have create an object model under Blender and I would like to use that single model to create several objects within my application.
       <br/>
       I create N nodes and for each one, I create a static model from the resource related to the model file “Models/Gate.mdl”.
       <br/>
       Here is the code snippet I use…
      </p>
      <pre><code>for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
{
  Node *myNode = mScene-&gt;CreateChild("Gate" + String(i));
  myNode-&gt;SetPosition(Vector(…, …, …));
  StaticModel *myModel = myNode-&gt;CreateComponent&lt;StaticModel&gt;();
  myModel-&gt;SetModel(mResourcesCache-&gt;GetResource&lt;Model&gt;("Models/Gate.mdl"));
  myModel-&gt;ApplyMaterialList();
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
       However, when I execute that code, I have some strange behaviors when I look at the objects. It seems that sometimes or depending on my camera position, some are visible and other are not, and they appear and disappear in a random fashion.
       <br/>
       So my main question is : is it possible (and maybe relevant) to create several objects from the same unique resource ? Do I have to duplicate the model resource to have one duplicated resource associated with one node ? I mean that if I create 10 nodes, do I have to create 10 different resources of the same model ?
       <br/>
       It is a little bit confusing to me, so any clarifications would be very welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best regards !

       Absolutely !.See example20  huge object count.The whole point of resources are to share them whenever possible.

       This is more likely a bounding box issue.Can you debug your geometry aabb ?

       Hi Dave,
       <br/>
       thanks for your quick answer. I had a look at the “HugeObjectCount.cpp” file and it gives a clear answer to my question.
       <br/>
       I should have had a look at it first before posting my question on the forum, I apologize
       <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/f6b86554472159b74d0ab91b2cb3cd75cf361ccf96a141a4ebd3363c38e7f8eb.png" title=":wink:"/>
       I will take care of the provided examples for next times.
       <br/>
       Anyway, this really helps and I did not know about the StaticModelGroup class. It seems to be very useful.
       <br/>
       Thanks !

       Also some people encounter issue similar to yours with auto-instancing. Try to disable it and see
       <br/>
       if that fixes your problem. Instancing from resources should work without StaticModelGroup too
       <br/>
       and without side-effects.
