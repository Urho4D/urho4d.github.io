       Hi, all!
      </p>
      <p>
       While struggling with GUI system I found several  major problems I’m unable to solve for very long time.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         In windowed mode, when window is controlled by window manager in X11
         <br/>
         I try to put simple menu (out of default buttons) in the center. For some strange reason, regardless of window
         <br/>
         size I see resolution reported to be 1024x768, so menu is offset and not really adequate. There’s no such
         <br/>
         problem with full screen, but I need windowed mode to be working right.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In many cases I want widgets to be automatically placed on screen. I know how to do it by hand,
         <br/>
         but is it possible to set some default for some container so everything there is autoplaced?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When Adding items to container dynamically, containers often break and display items one over another.
         <br/>
         It doesn’t happen when I just set up them once via xml.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I can’t make drop-down list work. Whatever I try I can’t see any items inside. I know it works in editor,
         <br/>
         but when I copy-paste it breaks.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I try this all with AngelScript.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I have additional question - is it possible to create custom widget using AnglScript? Most
       <br/>
       important widget I need it a button, and i can represent everything with buttons and windows,
       <br/>
       except for input boxes (which work too, so no problem here) but I’d like to have some changes on layout and
       <br/>
       style (I don’t need this GUI-system look, just clickable pic is fine), but I need widget-relative coordinates
       <br/>
       from mouse clicks, is it possible to implement with AngelScript-only?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks!
