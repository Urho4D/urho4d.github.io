       Hey ,
       <br/>
       it will be very logical to add sub forum for the editor , as it is big component by it self and keep get bigger .
       <br/>
       so questions can be found and asked easily
       <br/>
       ( based on other engines forums )
      </p>
      <p>
       also , i didn’t understand and its always confuse me , what is the difference between the sub forums :
       <br/>
       Support, and General Discussion  in both Engine and Engine related questions been asked …  ok maybe there are some Questions in the General support that are really general
       <br/>
       maybe good idea just to Consolidate them both to something like "Engine Discussion " or just rename the “Support” forum to “Engine support”
      </p>

       Our intent is to have a only  few subforums for readability,
       <br/>
       otherwise we should have “General”, “Feat request” , “Support”  for each component, you can add a label to specialize a thread.
