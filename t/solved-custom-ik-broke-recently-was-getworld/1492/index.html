       fixed, a 100% my fault.
       <br/>
       juggling of update orders is what got me. I was not calling the IK and or setting positions in the right place.
       <br/>
       Fixed now…

       [quote]After some digging it appears my initial diagnosis was incorrect. I believe that GetWorldTransform and GetWorldPosition are not to blame for my newfound issue.
       <br/>
       But it’s something in my IK code… Updated question/pondering in following post.

       [quote]I have a basic Ik set up that I have been successfully using for a little while…
       <br/>
       It’ been disabled for a while since I was working on some other stuff.
       <br/>
       Turned it back on tonight, and noticed some weirdness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using “HandleSceneDrawableUpdateFinished” event, every other frame it looks like I am getting invalid results. Not NANs, but inverted transforms is what it looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a hierarchy of nodes, I am trying to get a child of a child of a child. It’s almost as if one of the parent nodes is at 0,0,0 in transform or rotation is when I get the bogus values.
      </p>
      <p>
       This result is both the same for GetWorldTransform and GetWorldPosition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not sure the best way to confirm or replicate this, but wanted to put it out there in case someone has encountered the same thing, or has a simple test case.[/quote][/quote]

       I’ve got a custom IK setup that has been in working condition.
       <br/>
       It used some methods presented from this old post

        http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/solved-ik-foot-placement/1010/1
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Notably, the “HandleSceneDrawableUpdateFinished”, Which I am lead to believe/ blindly assume there were some changes that might have effected some of my GetWorldPostion calls, to get information on parent bones/nodes. (At least my first and second reaction is to blame the ( awesome) engine)
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening, that only on a few frames the math doesnt resolve and I get some frames that wig out, otherwise, all the other frames solve fine. I shall do more digging to try and pinpoint where the math fails, until then…
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I have no concrete examples, or proof. I come to the board in hopes that someone might be able to help me diagnose what might have changed so that I might fix this new issue i’m having.
