       Welcome to our forum.

       Although we try to be as inclusive as possible, our build scripts may not able to support all the combinations of IDE/Compiler/Host-system out there. Code::Blocks project using UNIX Makefile with MinGW cross-compiler on Linux host system has been tested to build our project fine. So does the “standalone” MinGW compiler on Windows host system. I can only suspect that the MinGW compiler shipped by the Code::Blocks binary download is the culprit. If you quickly google the “mingw” and “static-libstdc++” as your search keyword then you will find others have encountered the same problem as you as well. One of the search result catches my attention:
       <a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php">
        mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php
       </a>
       , then configure your Code::Blocks to use that toolchain. The TDM-GCC 4.81 may probably make the same ‘mistake’ as 4.71 in its handling of this compiler flag. So although it is more troublesome, if I were you I would go with standalone MinGW route.
