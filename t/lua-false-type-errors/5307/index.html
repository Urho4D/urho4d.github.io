       I am having some trouble with LUA errors, I have compiled urho3d with the URHO3D_SAFE_LUA at ver 1.7.1 with luajit and I keep getting strange type errors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am creating render surfaces so I need to use GetRGBAFormat but I can’t use it since it reports back to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       “GetRGBAFormat argument
       <span class="hashtag">
        #1
       </span>
       is ‘Graphics’; ‘Graphics’ expected”
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume this has something to do with the function being static? It worked when I disabled the safe lua flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone had this error before?

       I don’t know about this one, but I am having troubles on the angelscript side. I don’t use the standard application model, but then again I don’t do anything weird… we’re in the same boat.
       <br/>
       I actually do have experience in lua - which is why I chose not to use it.

       I think having wrappers in tolua++ is probably not ideal… its kind of old.
       <br/>
       I had been writing wrappers for lua before and opted for sol2 which made wrappers a breeze. I think overall the lua side could be improved substantially considering the way it handles resources.
      </p>

       Yesterday I worked on 2d stuff and in lua its impossible to create a Sprite2D on its own since its a resource so I had to copy code from the cpp source and process the rectangles myself and push em to the StaticSprite2D, its a shame really. urho3d is a pretty good engine tho it just needs a good clean up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although to be fair I am doing some strange things, currently I am stuck on a crash when I try to render the character sprite as I have a billboard with a render target and within that render target I am using another one and that always crashes which prompted me to get safe lua so I have a chance at debugging it.

       I do strange things too - I start my own application, I load my own scenes, I run my own scripts, and I get odd results, and no responses from the wings of this academy. Apparently, we’re all meant to live under the mantle.
